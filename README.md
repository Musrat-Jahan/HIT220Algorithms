## Here are all the algorithm-related topics this unit covered:

1. **Stack-based algorithms focused on searching for sequences within a stack of characters** 
2. **Recursive algorithms and their time complexity** 
3. **Recursive and iterative approaches to calculating factorials** 
4. **Sorting function without built-in sort functions (0 for black, 1 for red, and 2 for yellow)** 
5. **Tic Tac Toe modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM)** 
6. **Task management system using data structures and algorithms for adding, sorting, finding, and removing tasks**
7. **Testing sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort on provided arrays and randomly generated integers**
8. **Implementing and analyzing sorting algorithms: Insertion, Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick Sort** 
9. **Binary Search Tree (BST) operations: insert, delete, search, with tree structure and in-order traversal** 
10. **Solving recurrence relations using characteristic equations and factorization techniques**  
11. **Scrabble Score game: Time-based scoring mechanism and random word length generation** 
12. **Sorting algorithms for task management system, including complexity analysis** 
13. **Incident matrix and paths of length two in graph theory**
14. **Keyword analysis implementation using a Trie structure**
